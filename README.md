ActiveMerchant for Subscriptions

Just an idea.  There seems to be a distinct lack of apps and services that support Subscription-based service companies in the same generalized way that ActiveMerchant supports E-commerce/Click-n-Ship type companies.

This gem (which has no implementation currently) will do the following:
  1.  Provide a common DSL for managing subscriptions across Credit Card Gateways.
  2.  Be a complement to any app that is using [ActiveMerchant](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant) already.
  3.  Be familiar to anyone who has used ActiveMerchant.
